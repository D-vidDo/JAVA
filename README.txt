WHAT DOES THIS PROGRAM DO?
This program will allow the travel agent to find and book flight reservations for customers very easily.
The core features of this program are:

1. Find flights
	The travel agent can find a flight by providing the origin airport, the destination airport, and a day of the week the flight is departing.
2. Make a reservation
	The travel agent can make a flight reservation for a traveler. A reservation code will be generated and assigned to the travelerâ€™s name and citizenship. 
3. Find reservations
	The travel agent can find existing flight reservations using the reservation code, airline, and traveler name. The criteria can match any combination of the three fields.
4. Modify a reservation
	An existing flight reservation can be modified. The traveler name and citizenship can be updated.
	An existing flight reservation can be soft-deleted, marking it as inactive and freeing up a seat on the flight.
